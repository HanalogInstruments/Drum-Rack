# Drum-Rack
Based on Drumkid

# Lo-fi aleatoric Arduino drum machine

# Concept
A drum machine which generates rhythms using probability. Imagine a traditional step-based drum machine, but where various dice are rolled for each step, with the resulting numbers used to determine the behaviour of the beat.

# Buy Drumkid
You can buy Drumkid fully assembled or as a kit from <mattbradshawdesign.com>

# Setup
DrumKid is based around an Arduino Nano, and coded using the Arduino IDE. Audio is produced by the Mozzi library. You can build a version of DrumKid using an Arduino, a breadboard, and standard electronic components, or you can build/buy the "full" version described below.
